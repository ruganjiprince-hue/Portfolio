  <h2>Smart Irrigation System Using IoT and Solar Energy</h2>

  <p class="project-intro">
    A solar-powered, IoT-enabled irrigation system designed to optimize
    water usage through intelligent sensing, automation, and real-time monitoring
    promoting sustainable agriculture and efficient resource management.

         alt="Smart Irrigation System Architecture">

    <p>
      The system integrates soil moisture sensing, environmental monitoring,
      microcontroller-based decision logic, and a solar-powered energy supply.
      Sensor data is continuously evaluated to determine optimal irrigation timing.
      The IoT layer enables remote monitoring and system control via a web interface.

  <!-- ===== Problem Section ===== -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional irrigation relies heavily on manual scheduling,
      often leading to overwatering, water waste, and inconsistent crop conditions.
      The objective of this project was to design an autonomous system capable
      of making data-driven irrigation decisions in real time.

  <!-- ===== Hardware Section ===== -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Hardware Implementation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Soil Moisture Sensor for real-time soil condition analysis</li>
      <li>DHT Temperature & Humidity Sensor</li>

  <!-- ===== Software & Control Logic ===== -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Control Logic and IoT Integration</h3>
    <p>
      The control algorithm continuously monitors sensor inputs and activates
      irrigation only when moisture levels drop below a predefined threshold.
      Data is transmitted to a cloud-based IoT platform, enabling users to monitor
      soil conditions, system status, and irrigation events remotely.
