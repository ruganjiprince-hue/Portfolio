  <h2>Renewable Energy Grid Demand & Generation Analytics</h2>

  <p class="project-intro">
    A time-series analytics project exploring electricity demand patterns,
    renewable generation dynamics, and wind energy penetration using
    high-resolution grid data from Ireland and Northern Ireland.

    <h3>Problem Context</h3>
    <p>
      Modern electricity grids must balance fluctuating demand with increasing
      renewable energy integration. Understanding seasonal patterns,
      daily cycles, and renewable penetration is critical for ensuring
      grid stability and efficient energy planning.

    <h3>Time-Series Demand & Generation Analysis</h3>

         alt="Daily and Weekly Electricity Demand Trends">

    <p>
      Using 15-minute resolution grid data, daily and weekly averages
      were computed to reveal cyclic consumption behavior.
      Clear weekday-weekend demand differences were observed,
      reflecting human activity patterns.
      Renewable generation was closely aligned with demand,
      demonstrating effective grid responsiveness.

    <h4>Key Analytical Insights</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong seasonal variation in electricity demand</li>
      <li>Solar generation peaks in summer months</li>
      <li>Wind contributes approximately 30–33% of total demand</li>
      <li>Over-generation events indicate need for storage flexibility</li>
      <li>Statistically significant demand differences between weekdays and weekends</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== Statistical Analysis ===== -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Statistical Testing & Autocorrelation</h3>

    <p>
      Welch’s t-test was applied to compare weekday and weekend demand,
      confirming statistically significant differences in consumption patterns.
      Autocorrelation analysis (ACF) was performed on wind and solar generation
      to evaluate periodicity and predictability characteristics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Solar generation exhibited strong daily periodic behavior,
      while wind generation displayed more stochastic characteristics,
      highlighting forecasting challenges in renewable energy systems.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== Wind Penetration ===== -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Wind Energy Penetration Analysis</h3>

    <img src="../assets/projects/energy_wind_penetration.png"
         alt="Wind Energy Penetration Rate">

    <p>
      Wind penetration rate was calculated as the ratio of wind generation
      to total electricity demand. The results demonstrate substantial
      renewable contribution while also revealing periods of over-generation,
      emphasizing the importance of grid flexibility and storage solutions.

  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Impact & Relevance</h3>
    <p>
      This project demonstrates how time-series analytics and statistical
      modeling can provide actionable insights for renewable energy integration.
      The findings support data-driven energy planning, sustainable infrastructure
      development, and improved grid reliability.
    </p>

    <p>
      It highlights the importance of combining statistical rigor with
      practical interpretation when analyzing complex real-world systems.
