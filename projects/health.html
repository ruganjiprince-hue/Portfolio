  <h2>Global Health and Life Expectancy Prediction</h2>

  <p class="project-intro">
    A machine learning and data analytics project exploring how economic,
    healthcare, and demographic indicators influence global life expectancy,
    with a focus on interpretability and model performance comparison.

    <h3>Problem Context</h3>
    <p>
      Life expectancy is one of the most important indicators of population
      health and socioeconomic development. The objective of this project was
      to identify the most influential factors affecting life expectancy and
      to build predictive models capable of capturing complex relationships
      between health, economic, and demographic variables.
    </p>

  <!-- ===== Data Exploration ===== -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>

         alt="Global Life Expectancy Trends">

    <p>
      The dataset spans multiple countries over several years and includes
      indicators such as GDP, adult mortality, infant deaths, BMI, schooling,
      and vaccination coverage. Exploratory analysis revealed persistent
      disparities between developed and developing countries, with noticeable
      gaps in life expectancy progression.

    <h3>Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Handled missing values using statistical and KNN-based imputation</li>
      <li>Analyzed and mitigated outliers in GDP and expenditure features</li>
      <li>Engineered composite features such as Infant Survival Rate</li>
      <li>Created indices combining education and income variables</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- ===== Highlight Box ===== -->
  <div class="project-highlight">
    <h4>Key Modeling Insights</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensemble models significantly outperformed linear baselines</li>
      <li>Random Forest achieved the strongest overall predictive performance</li>
      <li>Top predictors included Income Composition, Adult Mortality, and Infant Deaths</li>
      <li>Reduced-feature models maintained competitive accuracy while improving interpretability</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== Modeling Section ===== -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Modeling and Evaluation</h3>

    <img src="../assets/projects/health_feature_importance.png"
         alt="Feature Importance for Life Expectancy Prediction">

    <p>
      Multiple regression models were evaluated, including Decision Trees,
      Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting.
      Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using GridSearchCV,
      and performance was compared using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== Impact Section ===== -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Impact and Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      The findings confirm that life expectancy is shaped by a combination of
      healthcare access, economic stability, and demographic conditions.
      By identifying the most influential features, this project supports
      evidence-based policy discussions and highlights actionable areas for
      improving global health outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project demonstrates the importance of combining predictive accuracy
      with interpretability to ensure that data-driven insights remain meaningful
      and socially responsible.
